# Banker-Chatbox-AWS-PROJECT-

## 🌟 Project Summary

This project showcases a chatbot built using **Amazon Lex**, designed to handle user intents such as greeting the user, checking account balances, and transferring money. The chatbot leverages **AWS Lambda** for backend processing and integrates features like:

- **Intent Recognition**: Custom intents, such as `WelcomeIntent`, greet users and handle specific conversational needs.
- **Context Tags**: Maintain conversational memory for improved user experience.
- **Customized Fallback Responses**: Enhanced user interaction by configuring `FallbackIntent` with user-friendly variations like, "Sorry, I’m having trouble understanding. Can you describe what you'd like to do in a few words?"
- **Confidence Settings**: Adjusted intent classification confidence score to 40%, optimizing chatbot responses to user queries.
- **Sample Utterances**: Ensures the chatbot recognizes multiple user inputs for the same intent.
- **Error Handling**: Clear fallback messages triggered when unrecognized inputs are received.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The chatbot integrates multiple AWS services:
- **Amazon Lex** for natural language processing.
- **AWS Lambda** for intent fulfillment.
- **IAM Roles** for secure interaction between AWS services.

## 🛠️ Key Features

1. **User Intent Management**:
   - Support for multiple intents to guide user interactions effectively.
   - Flexible sample utterances for better intent recognition.

2. **Customizable Fallback Handling**:
   - Configurable fallback responses enhance user satisfaction during errors.

3. **Rapid Deployment**:
   - Complete setup achieved in approximately 30 minutes using pre-configured AWS tools.

4. **Scalable and Secure**:
   - IAM roles ensure secure integration with AWS services.
   - Easily scalable to accommodate more intents or users.

5. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Variations in fallback responses for a personalized conversational flow.

## 🚀 Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- An active AWS account.
- IAM user with appropriate permissions.

### Steps
1. **Set Up Amazon Lex Bot**:
   - Create intents like `WelcomeIntent` with relevant utterances.
   - Configure fallback and response variations.

2. **Integrate AWS Lambda**:
   - Link Lambda functions to process user requests dynamically.

3. **Assign IAM Role**:
   - Attach policies such as `AmazonLexRunBotsOnly` to enable smooth operation.

4. **Test and Deploy**:
   - Test the chatbot in the Lex Console.
   - Deploy it for real-world interactions.

## 📚 Learnings and Challenges
- **Ease of Use**: Setting up the chatbot in Amazon Lex was straightforward and fast.
